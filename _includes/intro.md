## About Me



I'm currently a research assistant at China Agricultural University and University of Georgia. 
My current research interests include Automation, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Precision Agriculture, and Agricultural Robots.

## Research Interests

- **Precision Agriculture & Agricultural Robotics**: My research centers on the integration of automation and robotics into precision agriculture. I design intelligent agricultural systems capable of performing tasks such as intra-row weeding, precision spraying, and automated harvesting. I am particularly interested in developing lightweight and efficient robotic platforms that can operate reliably in unstructured field environments.
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning for Smart Farming**: I focus on building high-performance computer vision models tailored to agricultural applications. My work involves optimizing CNN and Transformer-based architectures (e.g., customized YOLO variants and ViT models) for tasks such as crop/weed classification, pest detection, and growth monitoring. I aim to achieve robust performance under diverse field conditions such as variable lighting and occlusion.
- **High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping (HTPP)**: My upcoming research explores the deployment of AI-powered phenotyping systems to extract large-scale, multi-modal plant trait data across time and space. I am particularly interested in drone and ground-platform-based imaging, multimodal sensor fusion, and deep learning-driven trait extraction for stress detection, yield estimation, and postharvest quality analysis.
- **AI-Driven Control Systems in Agriculture**: I also explore the use of advanced control algorithms, such as Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), to improve the real-time responsiveness and robustness of agricultural equipment. This work aims to bridge the gap between intelligent perception and autonomous action in complex agricultural environments.
